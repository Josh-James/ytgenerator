#Youtube Video Generator
##Intro
The goal of this program is to generate truly randomized youtube videos not dictated by an alogorithm.
##How to use
Simply run *main.py* and have Chrome installed (Do not have Chrome open, the chromedriver does not always work when it is opened).

**Tip:** Chromedriver may need to be updated depending on when the program is ran, simply search for the right chromedriver.exe in your search engine of choice
